<!-- Project Description -->
<img src="./readme/title2.svg"/>

> The aim of the EcoTech project is to develop a comprehensive application that harnesses various technologies to help prevent and alert firefighters and forest guards about potential wildfire outbreaks. The application utilizes React Native (Expo) for the mobile app, Node.js with Express for the backend, MongoDB Atlas for database storage, AWS server for cloud infrastructure, Arduino for sensor data collection, OpenAI for predictive analytics, and Firebase for real-time notifications.

EcoTech's primary goal is to enhance forest safety by collecting vital data such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, and other factors that can indicate a wildfire. This data is gathered through sensors connected to an Arduino and sent to an AI system that predicts potential fire outbreaks. If a threat is detected, the app sends real-time notifications to nearby firefighting stations and forest guards, enabling prompt and efficient response. The user base for this application includes firefighters, forest guards, and environmentally-conscious individuals committed to safeguarding forests and wildlife.

In addition to its critical wildfire prevention functionality, EcoTech offers a unique feature that promotes community engagement in reforestation efforts. Users can view a map displaying the locations of forest sensors and contribute to reforestation by planting trees. These planted trees will be marked on the map, similar to a Snapchat heatmap.

Potential challenges for EcoTech include ensuring accurate and timely data collection and analysis, securing funding for sensor installation and maintenance, and fostering user engagement for the tree-planting feature.

### User Types
1. Firefighters and Forest Guards
2. General Users (Environmentally-conscious individuals)

Features of the App:

As a Firefighter or Forest Guard, I want to:
- Receive real-time notifications of potential wildfire outbreaks for early prevention.
- Monitor live data from various forest sensors to understand the current forest conditions.
- Access the latest news and updates related to wildfires.
- Receive alerts regarding evacuation procedures.
- Receive information about the fire risk in particular areas.

As a General User, I want to:
- View the locations of forest sensors to understand where monitoring is taking place.
- Mark locations where I've planted trees to contribute to reforestation efforts and community engagement.
- Receive information about the fire risk in particular areas.
- Access the latest news and updates related to wildfires.
